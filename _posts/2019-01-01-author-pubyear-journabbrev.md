Replace the filename with the date of your blog post and the `author`, `publication year`, and `journal abbreviation` of the article you're blogging about.<br>
For example: `2019-04-19-gruneir-2007-med-care-res-rev.md`

Replace everything in the header above _except for the `layout` part_. That should always stay as `post`. The `tags` part can be left empty, but if you want to add relevant tags to your post for easier lookup/grouping later, add them as a list with tags separated by commas, for example: `[rsfMRI,sleep]`.

Here are a few sentences for another paragraph. Leave a space between paragraphs, otherwise it will be attached to the previous one. Try it out yourself and see what it looks like. Add as many sentences as you would like. **This part is bold** and _this part is italicized_. Okay.

Here we can make a list
1. of
2. numbered
3. things.

* or a list
* that is
* un-numbered.

It's easy to include links in your text. All you do is put brackets around the [site you want to link to](https://github.com/remrama/readordie) and then the link following in parentheses.

Lastly, images can be useful. There are [multiple ways](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet#images) to insert images, but I prefer the one using html syntax because you can center them.
