# readordie

Looking for motivation to read more scientific articles?? [READ OR DIE](https://remrama.github.io/readordie/) is your solution!

Every week we all chip in to a PayPal "money pool" and only those who read articles and write blog posts about them over the course of a week get their money back. The others leave it in the pool.

We utilize [GitHub](https://github.com) for hosting the site and blog posts and [PayPal](https://www.paypal.com) for handling the money, so you'll need accounts for both to participate.
